Data Source(s),Code,Meaning
,!,Data deviate from historically established concentration ranges.
,*,Not reported or not analyzed due to interference
,?,Data are rejected and should not be used
,A,Value reported is the mean of two or more determinations
,B,Results based upon colony counts outside the acceptable range
,D,Field measurement
,E,Composite sample from multiple stations
,F,Indicates female sex
,G,"The analyte was detected at or above the method detection limit in both the sample and the associated field blank, equipment blank, or trip blank, and the blank value was greater than 10% of the associated sample value. The value in the blank shall not be subtracted from associated samples."
,H,Value based on field kit determination
,I,Result value is between the laboratory method detection limit and the laboratory practical quantitation limit.
,J,Estimated value questionable or not accurate
,K,Actual value is known to be less than the value given
,L,Actual value is known to be greater than the value given
,M,"Presence of material verified, but not quantified"
,N,Presumptive evidence of presence of material
,O,Sampled for but analysis lost or not performed
,Q,Sample held beyond accepted holding time
,R,Significant rain in the past 48 hours
,S,Secchi disk visible to bottom of waterbody. The value reported is the depth of the waterbody at the location of the Secchi disk measurement
,T,Value reported is less than the laboratory method detection limit
,U,Material was analyzed for but not detected
,V,Analyte was detected in both the sample and the associated method blank
,W,"Value observed is less than lowest value reportable under T code. This code is used when a positive value is not observed or calculated for a result, i.e., the test instrument or calculation is not capable of producing negative values."
,X,"Indicates, when reporting results from a Stream Condition Index Analysis (LT 7200 and FS 7420), that insufficient individuals were present in the sample to achieve a minimum of 280 organisms for identification (the method calls for two aliquots of 140-160 organisms), suggesting either extreme environmental stress or a sampling error."
,Y,Analysis form unpreserved or improperly preserved sample
,Z,Too many colonies were present - the numeric value represents the filtration volume.
