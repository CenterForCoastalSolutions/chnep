Data cleaning for Task 1 of CHNEP water quality trend analysis project.

When running the .R and .Rmd files, be sure to update the working directory to your local path in the setwd() call near the top of the script.

The input data provided by USF ('Trend Analysis - CHNEP - 2020 - Export.txt') and the clean dataframe ('') are stored elsewhere (not on github).

See the markdown document for details about the data cleaning script.
